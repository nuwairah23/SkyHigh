# SkyHigh Flight Booking Web App

SkyHigh is an exciting web application that empowers users to book flights for their dream holiday trips. With two distinct views tailored for both admins and flight users, the application offers a seamless and intuitive booking experience. Each user is authenticated to access the pages and functionalities relevant to their roles. This project utilizes the MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework with Java as the primary programming language in the Eclipse IDE platform. MySQL serves as the database management system, and XAMPP along with PHPMyAdmin were used to manage the database.The UI of the app has been carefully designed using Figma, providing a fresh and visually appealing look. This is a group project as part of the CSC584 coursework.

## Features

- **Flight Booking**: Users can easily search and book flights for their desired holiday destinations.

- **User and Admin View**: The application includes an admin view that facilitates efficient management and oversight of flight schedules and user data. It also includes a user view to create, view, update and delete flight bookings.
